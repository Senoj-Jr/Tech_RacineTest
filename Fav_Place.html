            <img src="images_kk/padmanabhapuram-palace.jpg" alt="palace">
            <p>Then I visited the famous Padmanabhapuram Palace. I just loved to be there. Once the capital of the princely state of Travancore, the palace was the royal seat of the Travancore rulers until the 18th century, when the capital was moved to Thiruvananthapuram.
            The palace, built primarily of wood, is renowned for its exquisite craftsmanship, intricate woodwork, and traditional design elements. It is surrounded by a 4 km long stone fortress and nestled at the foot of the Veli Hills, which adds to its majestic charm.The palace also houses an impressive collection of antique furniture, ornate wooden ceilings.</p>

            <img src="images_kk/hotel-seaview.jpg" alt="Hotel">
            <p>There are various seaside restaurants and hotels available near the tourist spots. I enjoyed staying at a hotel called Hotel Sea View. It was a nice experience. There are also other hotels available around the sea area. The cost for the stay is not very economical, but the experience and the quality of food are nice there.Hostels in Kanyakumari are known for their friendly atmosphere, where travelers can easily meet and interact with others from different parts of the world. Some hostels even offer organized activities like group tours, beach outings, and cultural events, allowing guests to fully immerse themselves in the local experience.While the facilities might be more modest compared to hotels, the hostels often make up for it with their vibrant community and helpful staff.</p>

            <p>Kanyakumari offers a rich culinary experience that reflects the diverse flavors of South Indian cuisine. The town's seaside location means that fresh seafood is a highlight, with local eateries serving up an array of dishes featuring fish, prawns, and crabs, often spiced with regional spices and herbs. The coastal influence is evident in dishes like meen curry (fish curry) and prawn masala, which are beloved by both locals and visitors.Meals typically feature staples such as idli (steamed rice cakes), dosa (thin, crispy crepes), and sambar (a spicy lentil stew), often enjoyed with coconut chutney and a variety of pickles.</p>
